## My process

### Built with

- Use of OpenWeather API, Javascript, jQuery, moments.js, CSS (including Bootstrap) and HTML
<br><br>
### What I learned

APIs offer a world of access to 3rd party data
<br><br>
By setting variables to certain factors we can display specific results the API lets us find up on our screen for our users
